# AI Models Directory

This directory is where you can place AI models that assist with the interpreter or are loaded by it.

## Supported Formats
- `.apl` (APL source files defining models)
- `.pt` / `.pth` (PyTorch weights)
- `.gguf` (Llama.cpp format - requires conversion)

## Assistant Models
To enable the "AI Assistant" feature in the interpreter, place a text generation model here or configure the API key in `config.json` (coming soon).
